# Shopping App

This is a web application created with React (create-react-app). It fetches data using Axios from fakestoreapi.com, and displays all products with a rating higher than 4.5 on the homepage.

The second page displays all products and provides filtering functionality for users.

The cart page allows users to add and remove products, including new ones, and calculates the total cost of all selected items at the bottom of the page.

Tech stack:

* React with create-react-app
